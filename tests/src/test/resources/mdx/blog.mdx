Paris, the city of lights and love, is a destination that promises an enchanting experience. Last weekend, I had the chance to immerse myself in the beauty and charm of this magnificent city.

## Day 1: Arrival and the Louvre

We arrived in Paris on a sunny Friday morning. After settling into our hotel, we headed straight to the iconic Louvre Museum.

The Louvre's extensive collection, from ancient civilizations to mid-19th century European art, is a testament to the rich history and culture of France.

## Day 2: Eiffel Tower and Seine River Cruise

No trip to Paris is complete without a visit to the Eiffel Tower. We spent our morning marvelling at this architectural wonder.

In the evening, we enjoyed a serene cruise along the Seine River, witnessing the city's landmarks illuminated against the night sky.

## Day 3: Montmartre and Farewell

Our final day in Paris took us to the artistic neighborhood of Montmartre. We wandered through its charming streets and visited the famous Sacré-Cœur Basilica.
